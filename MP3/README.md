Mini Project 3: Machine Learning for Prediction by Regression
In the file house-data.csv you will find data from the property market in King
County, USA.
Your task is to use the data for training a regression model that can be used for
prediction of prices of properties not listed in the file.
- Consider cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering of the data before
using it for building a model.
- Reduce the dimensionality of the model by ignoring the least informative
attributes.
- Apply different types of regression models – linear, multiple linear,
polynomial, and compare their accuracy in prediction.
- Store the best fitted model for future use.
Submit a link to Github repository of your solution, where in the readme file provide
answers of the following questions:
- What type/s of regression have you applied?
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression

- Which were the challenges?
Data cleaning and preprocessing took time, especially handling missing values and transforming categorical variables.
Selecting the right features and model parameters required experimentation.
Balancing model complexity (overfitting with polynomial regression) and accuracy.

- How accurate is your solution?
The R² score was 76484977061.77612 for the best model, and the Mean Squared Error was 0.49406905389089006.
- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?
Implement regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Explore more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for regression.
This is a group project.
